      "message": "Welcome to the Outbound Funds Module Fundseeker Starter Portal Template installer!\r\n\r\nOutbound Funds Module Fundseeker Starter Portal Template streamlines the grantmaking process and helps grantmakers cultivate and manage relationships with their grantees. Leveraging Salesforce Communities, Grants Management makes grantmaking a breeze through an intuitive, easy-to-use interface and backend automation.\r\n\r\n*IMPORTANT*: Salesforce does not recommend installing upgrades directly in production organizations. Instead, install Grants Management in one of your free sandbox environments or a developer organization first.\r\n\r\nOnce you've installed Grants Management, check out these resources:\r\n\r\n* [Grants Management Documentation](https://powerofus.force.com/s/article/GM-Documentation)\r\n* [Power of Us Hub - Grants Management Customer Group](https://powerofus.force.com/s/group/0F91E0000000iEwSAI/grants-management-sfdo-product)\r\n* [Salesforce Partner Community - Grants Management Experts Group](https://partners.salesforce.com/_ui/core/chatter/groups/GroupProfilePage?g=0F94V000000LpYeSAK)",
