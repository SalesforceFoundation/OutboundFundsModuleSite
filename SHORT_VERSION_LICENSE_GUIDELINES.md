# Open Source Short Version Guideline

In order to follow the Open Source Standard a short version of the license should be added at the top of any file that supports inline comments.

The short version should follow the way the comments are used on the file. We are following three different formats as listed below.

-   Apex Classes, JS, and CSS

    ```

         */
    ```

-   HTML, and XML

    ```

## Important

The short version of the license should not be added to any JSON file.
